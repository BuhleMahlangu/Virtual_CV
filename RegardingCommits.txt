Coding for the Virtual CV was done mainly in the CV_and_Projects Repository 
however upon viewing the rubric I realised that the Virtual CV must have its own repository,
and I then proceeded to create a new repository (Virtual_CV) and moved the code to the new repository
hence most commits are on the CV_and_Projects repository
